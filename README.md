The world in 2020 has faced different hurdles and difficult conversations about inclusion. The Oscars have been a topic of these conversations for years and under scrutiny for lack of diversity in multiple fronts.  

The goal of this analysis is to understand if minorities are underrepresented in the Oscars, and if this representation reflects the United Statesâ€™ population. These minority groups include gender, race, LGBT+ and people with disabilities.  

We chose to analyze diversity within a few of the main Oscars categories: Director, Lead Actor and Actress, Supporting Actor and Actress, Original and Adapted Screenplay and Original Score. We looked at data from 2015 to 2020 and found that the pattern of nominations and winners usually favors heterossexual white males with no disabilities.
